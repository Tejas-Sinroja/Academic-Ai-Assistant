## Feature Implementation Details

### PDF Chat Feature

The PDF Chat feature uses an advanced RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) implementation:

1. **Document Processing**:
   - PDFs are uploaded and processed using PyPDFLoader
   - Documents are split into manageable chunks with RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
   - Each chunk is converted to vector embeddings using HuggingFace Embeddings

2. **Vector Storage and Retrieval**:
   - Embeddings are stored in FAISS vector store
   - When a question is asked, the most relevant document chunks are retrieved
   - A custom prompt template guides the LLM to use only the retrieved context

3. **Session Management**:
   - Chat history is preserved in session state with a unique key for each document
   - History is also stored in the database for persistence between sessions
   - Each interaction is logged with timestamps and source attribution

### Quiz & Analyze Feature

The Quiz & Analyze feature uses LLMs to generate educational assessments:

1. **Content Extraction**:
   - Extracts text from PDFs, notes, or direct input
   - Uses representative sampling for longer documents

2. **Question Generation**:
   - Prompts the LLM to create multiple-choice questions
   - Parses the response with regex to extract questions and answers
   - Validates the output to ensure proper formatting

3. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Calculates scores and identifies knowledge gaps
   - Generates personalized feedback and study recommendations
   - Saves results to database for progress tracking

## Project Structure
